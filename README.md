# The SGFY Interpreter
This is the official SGFY interpreter. It is like many other interpreters in that it can parse live as well as parse from a file. As it and the language evolves, it may develop more advanced features or perhaps even become a compiler.

Currently, linux x64 is the only platform which will recieve regular releases. Linux x86 will likely never recieve any official releases. Windows x64 will recieve occasional releases. Windows x86 will likely never recieve any official releases. Mac will not recieve any official releases.

#Using the SGFY Interpreter
The interpreter is designed for use via the terminal. On a linux system, the program can be launched using ./SGFY

If you want to interprate a file, you can use the flag --file [file location].
