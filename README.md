# The SGFY Interpreter
This is the SGFY interpreter. It can interpret SGFY code live via console or load a file and run based on that.

#What is SGFY
SGFY is short for 'Shit got fucked, yo'. SGFY is based on brainfuck but adds a couple additional features such as random numbers, switching output modes, and differentiation in respect to x.
